The listener's audio aura, based on their top 100 songs, could be described as [e.g., "high energy, low valence, and highly danceable"], which suggests they prefer [e.g., "upbeat, but emotionally intense and danceable music"].
However, this method might not fully represent the listener's preferences because it only considers one year's worth of data, focuses on a limited set of musical features, and only looks at the top 100 songs, potentially missing out on significant parts of the listener's musical identity.
A better method might include analyzing a broader range of features (for example, tempo, loudness), considering multiple years of data, using weighted averages, conducting cluster analysis, and even incorporating sentiment analysis of lyrics to get a more comprehensive and representative view of the listener's audio aura.
